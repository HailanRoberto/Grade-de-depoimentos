                heard some people who has amazing experience here. I signed up <br> for the free intro course and found it incredibly
                fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next <br> 12 weeks was the best - and most gruelling - time of my life. Since
                completing the course. <br> I´ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, I´ve <br> never written a line of code.
                I needed <br> some structure from professionals <br> who can help me
                learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former student of theirs <br>
                who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br>
                curriculum and staff did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>
                and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team project, in <br>
                particular, was outstanding. It took <br> my learning to the next level in a way <br>
                that no tutorial could ever have. In <br> fact, I´ve often referred to it during <br>
                interviews as an example of my <br> developent experience. It certainly <br> helped me
                land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 100% recommend!"
